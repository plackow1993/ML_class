# ML_class

2/7/22 - Ken - functions.py contains each error function we want to use: misclass, gini, and entropy. A subset of a dataframe with the last column being the target classifications will work as input. I have two test DF's in the file to check on its utility if you like.

2/9/22 - Ken - chi_2.py contains the full computation of chi squared statistic. Will have to adjust to be called into our code, but it computes chi and makes a decision for any dataframe. The inputs will have to be alpha, attribute to split, key of target classes column.

Testing something out
